//  Showreel  --  the backdrop: space, or sky and ground, painted by the PPA
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Large flat areas cost the CPU nothing when the PPA paints them (the
//  approach of Stunt Racer's main/backdrop.c). A scene declares its
//  backdrop (scene.h):
//
//    space        one colour everywhere (zero-initialised: black) -- one
//                 full-screen FILL, as the showreel always had
//    sky/ground   the horizon (horizon.h) splits the screen. The PPA
//                 fills every row wholly on one side with that side's
//                 colour; the CPU paints only the wedge a rolled horizon
//                 cuts out of the band between, which is empty when the
//                 camera is level.
//
//  The ground is a plane at infinity: geometry drawn over it (a landing
//  pad, buildings) stands on it, and the backdrop needs no depth.
//
//  Per frame: set the camera, backdrop_begin() (queues the fills), do the
//  pixel-free work (submit, prepare) while the PPA runs, then
//  backdrop_finish() before the first framebuffer write.
