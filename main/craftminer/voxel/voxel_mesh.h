//  CraftMiner  --  meshing blocks
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Turns a box of blocks into a mesh (mesh.h) of the faces that can be
//  seen. Four kinds of block:
//
//    solid cubes   grass, dirt, stone, water... A face is emitted where
//                  the neighbour does not hide it: air, a plant, a
//                  torch, or a see-through cube. Water is opaque (the
//                  engine has no blending), as in Minecraft's "fast"
//                  mode.
//    see-through   leaves and glass: cubes with cut-out texels (holes,
//                  se_texture.h), so what is behind them shows. Leaves
//                  show their faces towards other leaves too (a canopy
//                  you see into); glass hides glass.
//    plants        flowers and tall grass: two crossed quads through
//                  the cell, each drawn from both sides.
//    torches       a thin stick in the middle of the cell.
//
//  Neighbouring cube faces of one material in one plane merge into one
//  rectangle (greedy meshing); textures repeat once per block, since the
//  UVs run in block units and the engine repeats them. Grass sides merge
//  only sideways, so each block keeps its own strip of grass.
//
//  Three kinds of mesh, chosen by the caller (voxel_render.c) by
//  distance:
//
//    VOX_MESH_FANCY  everything: canopies you see into, plants.
//    VOX_MESH_FAST   see-through cubes count as solid (no insides) and
//                    leaves take the opaque "fast" texture; no plants.
//
//  The same fast mesh serves flat colours further off; a grid of cells
//  `step` 2 blocks across (a half-resolution world, the caller's
//  choice of block per cell) gives about a quarter of the triangles for
//  the distance. A half-resolution chunk rounds the ground a block up or
//  down, so where it meets a full-resolution one the two surfaces step;
//  its `skirt` closes the step (its outer side faces are always drawn),
//  or the sky would show through the crack.
//
//  Pure data, no engine calls: the host mesh check builds and verifies
//  it (tools/meshcheck_assets.h).
