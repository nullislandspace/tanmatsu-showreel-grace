//  Showreel  --  where the horizon lies on screen
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Every point of a level plane at infinity projects onto one straight
//  screen line, the plane's vanishing line: the horizon. Two far points
//  at eye height, to either side of the view, define it (from Stunt
//  Racer's backdrop). Unlike Stunt Racer's, the camera here may roll
//  past 90 degrees (barrel rolls, a steep take-off), so this also says
//  which side of the line the ground is on.
//
//  Uses only the engine's camera (render_camera / render_project), so
//  the host-side check (make scenecheck) tests it against its stand-in.
